# Flix

Flix is an app that allows users to browse movies from the [The Movie Database API](http://docs.themoviedb.apiary.io/#).


In the application a user can see an app icon on the home screen and a styled launch screen. A user can view and scroll through a list of movies now playing in theaters and view the movie poster image for each movie.

In the application a user can tap a cell to see more details about a particular movie. A collectionView was utilized so that a user can tap a tab bar button to view a grid layout of Movie Posters using a CollectionView.
